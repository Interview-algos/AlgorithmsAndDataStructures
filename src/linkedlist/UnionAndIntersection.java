/**
 * Following are simple algorithms to get union and intersection lists
 * respectively.
 * 
 * Intersection (list1, list2) Initialize result list as NULL. Traverse list1
 * and look for its each element in list2, if the element is present in list2,
 * then add the element to result.
 * 
 * Union (list1, list2): Initialize result list as NULL. Traverse list1 and add
 * all of its elements to the result. Traverse list2. If an element of list2 is
 * already present in result then do not insert it to result, otherwise insert.
