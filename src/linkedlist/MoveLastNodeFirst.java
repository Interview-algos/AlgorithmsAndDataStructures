/**

 * 
 * @author rkumar1 Write a C function that moves last element to front in a
 *         given Singly Linked List. For example, if the given Linked List is
 *         1->2->3->4->5, then the function should change the list to
 *         5->1->2->3->4.
 * 
 *         1) Traverse the linked list till last node. 2) Use two pointers â€“ one
 *         points to last node and other to second last node. 3) After the end
 *         of loop do following operations. i) Make second last as last, set
 *         next of it to NULL. ii) Set next of last as root. iii) Make last as
 *         root node.
